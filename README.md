# Hotkeys

Display shortcuts for the currently focused application.

Currently only works on MacOS.

## Why?

Too many sticky notes with random key combinations on my desk.

Can never find the one you need.

## Usage

```bash
# install deps
pipenv install

# run the script
pipenv run python hotkeys.py
```
